= Tavern Brawler =
_1st Level Feat_

*Prerequisite:* None
*Repeatable:* No

Accustomed to brawling, you gain the following benefits:

*Enhanced Unarmed Strike.* When you hit with your Unarmed Strike* and deal damage, you can deal Bludgeoning Damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the normal damage of an Unarmed Strike.

*Damage Rerolls.* Whenever you roll a damage die for your Unarmed Strike, you can reroll the die if it rolls a 1, and you must use the new roll. 

*Shove.* When you hit a creature with an Unarmed Strike as part of the Attack Action on your turn, you can deal damage to the target and also push it 5 feet away. You can use this benefit only once per turn.

*Furniture as Weapons.* You can wield furniture as a Weapon, using the rules of the Greatclub for Small or Medium furniture and the rules of the Club for Tiny furniture.
