= Magic Initiate =
_1st Level Feat_

*Prerequisite:* None
*Repeatable:* Yes, but you must choose a different Spell list each time

You have learned the basics of a particular magical tradition. Choose one Spell list: Arcane, Divine, or Primal. You gain the following benefits related to that choice:

*Two Cantrips.* You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Spell list.

*1st-Level Spell.* Choose one 1st-level Spell from the Spell list. You always have that Spell prepared. You can cast it once without a Spell Slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest.* You can also cast the Spell using any Spell Slots you have.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these Spells (choose when you select this Feat). Consult the Playerâ€™s Handbook for the rules on spellcasting.

Whenever you gain a new level, you can replace one of the Spells you chose for this Feat with a different Spell of the same level from the chosen Spell list.
