= Feats =
This section offers a collection of 1st-level Feats, which are special features not tied to a single Class. At 1st level, your character gains a Feat from the character’s Background.

== Parts of a Feat ==
The description of a Feat contains the following parts, which are presented after the Feat’s name:

*Level.* Each Feat has a level. To take a Feat, your level must equal or exceed the Feat’s level.

*Prerequisite.* You must meet any prerequisite specified in a Feat to take that Feat. If you lose a Feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that Feat until you regain the prerequisite.

*Repeatable.* If a Feat is repeatable, you can take it more than once. If it isn’t repeatable, you can take the Feat only once.
