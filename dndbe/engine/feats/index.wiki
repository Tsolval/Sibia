= Feats =
This section offers a collection of 1st-level Feats, which are special features not tied to a single Class. At 1st level, your character gains a Feat from the character’s Background.

== Parts of a Feat ==
The description of a Feat contains the following parts, which are presented after the Feat’s name:

*Type.* These tags identify the Feat Types.  Anyone can take Feats with the General type.  Feat types, such ase Resource, Fighting Style, etc., subdivide Feats into groups.
*Level.* Each Feat has a level. To take a Feat, your level must equal or exceed the Feat’s level.  If a level is not listed, it's level is 1.
*Class.* Each Feat is available to one or more classes.  To take this feat, you must be a member of the class or class group listed.  If nothing is listed, this Feat is available to everyone.  
*Repeatable.* If a Feat is repeatable, you can take it more than once. If it isn’t repeatable, you can take the Feat only once. Some feats are Repeatable on a condition. 
*Prerequisite.* If a Feat requires any other prerequisite, like race or abilty score restrictions, they will be mentioned here.
