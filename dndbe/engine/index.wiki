  * 'C' is for [[classes/index|Class]]
  * 'D' is for Details 
  * 'E' is for Equipment

== Attributes ==
D&D uses an attribute score - a number between 3 and 18, to start, usually with a max of 20 - to determine what the ability mod is, and then uses the ability mod almost everywhere.  The only exceptions I can think of deal with the amount of weight you can carry or the distance you can jump.

We can replace the score with the modifier to simplify the system.

== Skills ==
Add the Crafting Skill to the skills list.
Evaluate adding a Lore skill.  Maybe move Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion to Lore skills.  Other Lore Skills: Technology, Alchemy

== Fighting Style: Superior Technique ==
Rework the Superior Technique fighting style so that it allows the player to choose an additional tactics feat.
