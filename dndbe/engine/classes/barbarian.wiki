== Barbarian Feats ==
=== Rage ===
Level: 0
Requirements: First class or 13+ Strength if Multiclassing
Repeatable: No
Multiclass Proficiencies: Shields, Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons

You have a Rage [[../resource-die|Resource Die]] which starts as a 1d4.  As you grow in power as a Barbarian, your Resource Die will grow with you, and you will gain other abilities that utilize your Resource Die as well.  Your Resource Die increases at levels 5 (1d6), 9 (1d8), 13 (1d10), 17(1d12). 
You can use your Rage Resource Die to perform the following actions so long as you aren't wearing heavy armor.  You will gain more features that consume your resource as you advance in this class.
 * *Raging Blows.* When you take the Attack Action on your turn and hit with a Weapon Attack, you can roll the Resource Die and add the result to your weapon damage.  
 * *Raging Strength.* When you make a d20 Test involving Strength, you can roll your Resource Die and add the result to your d20 Test.
 * *Raging Resistance.* Until you have exhausted your Rage, you are resistant to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.  When you are damaged by an attack that deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you may attempt to reduce that damage further.  As a reaction, roll your Rage Resource Die and subtract the result from the resisted damage of the triggering attack.

=== Unarmored Defense ===
Level: 1
Requirements: Barbarian
Repeatable: No

While you are not wearing armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity Modifier + your Constitution Modifier.  You can use a shield and still gain this benefit, since a shield counts as cover, not as armor.

=== Reckless Attack ===
Level: 1
Requirements: Barbarian
Repeatable: No

You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation.  When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly.  Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

=== Danger Sense ===
Level: 1
Requirements: Barbarian
Repeatable: No

You gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.  You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells.  To gain this benefit, you cannot be Blinded, Deafened, or Incapacitated.

=== Qualifying General Feats ===
 * Fighting Initiate
 * Athlete
 * Crusher
 * Dual Wielder
 * Durable
 * Grappler
 * Savage Attacker
 * Slasher
 * Tavern Brawler
 * Tough
 * Weapon Master

=== Extra Attack ===
Level: 5
Requirements: Warrior
Repeatable: No

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

=== Fast Movement ===
Level: 5
Requirements: Barbarian
Repeatable: No

Your speed increases by 10 feet while you arenâ€™t wearing heavy armor.

=== Feral Instinct ===
Level: 5
Requirements: Barbarian
Repeatable: No

Your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.  In addition, at the start of your first turn after rolling initiative, so long as you are not Incapacitated, you can roll your Rage Resource Die and gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the result.  While you are protected by your Rage in this way, you may act normally on your turn, even if you would otherwise be unable to due to being surprised, frightened, petrified, slowed, etc.

=== Brutal Critical ===
Level: 9
Requirements: Barbarian
Repeatable: No

You can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.  

=== Relentless Rage ===
Level: 9
Requirements: Barbarian
Repeatable: No

Your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds.  While you retain your Rage, if you drop to 0 hit points and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, adding a roll of your Rage Resource Die.  If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.  Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5.  When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

=== Brutal Critical II ===
Level: 13
Requirements: Barbarian, Brutal Critical
Repeatable: No

You can roll another additional weapon damage die, for a total of 2, when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.  

=== Persistent Rage ===
Level: 13
Requirements: Barbarian
Repeatable: No

TODO: What to change this to??
Your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.

=== Brutal Critical III ===
Level: 17
Requirements: Barbarian, Brutal Critical II
Repeatable: No

You can roll another additional weapon damage die, for a total of 3, when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.  

=== Indomitable Might ===
Level: 17
Requirements: Barbarian, Brutal Critical II
Repeatable: No

Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

=== Primal Champion ===
Level: 20
Requirements: Barbarian, Brutal Critical II
Repeatable: No

At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.
