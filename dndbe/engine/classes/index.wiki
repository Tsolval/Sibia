= Multiclassing =
If you are already a member of one or more classes and wish to take membership in a new class, you must meet the Multiclassing Requirements for your existing classes, as well as for the new one.  You then gain the Multiclass Proficiencies listed in the new class, if you don't already have them, and take the class feat.

When you take a new class, you gain the Resource Die for that class unless you already have a Resource Die of the same name.  In this case, the levels of all classes with the same Resource contribute to the scaling of that Resource Die.

Some classes share features.  For instance, several classes can take the Extra Attack feat at level 5.  You cannot take these features more than once and they do not stack with features that grant Effects of the same name.

= Revised Classes =
You take a class feat which grants you one or more game tags, your class defining proficiencies, a class resource, a number of class features which consume your resource, and 2 more options of your choice from the given selections.  You also gain a purse of coins which you can use to buy starting equipment.

= Class Feats =

== Barbarian: Rage ==
*Level.* 0
*Requirements.* First class or 13+ Constitution if Multiclassing
*Repeatable.* No
*Multiclass Proficiencies.* Shields, Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons

*Rage.* You have a Rage [[../resource-die|Resource Die]] which starts as a 1d4.  As you grow in power as a Barbarian, your Resource Die will grow with you, and you will gain other abilities that utilize your Resource Die as well.

*Rage DC.*  If your Rage Resource action calls for a save, the DC for the check is equal to 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Constitution Modifier.  

You can use your Rage Resource Die to perform the following actions so long as you aren't wearing heavy armor.  You will gain more features that consume your resource as you advance in this class.
 * *Raging Blows.* When you take the Attack Action on your turn and hit with a Weapon Attack, you can roll the Resource Die and add the result to your weapon damage.  
 * *Raging Strength.* When you make a d20 Test involving Strength, you can roll your Resource Die and add the result to your d20 Test.
 * *Raging Resistance.* Until you have exhausted your Rage, you are resistant to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.  When you are damaged by an attack that deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you may attempt to reduce that damage further.  As a reaction, roll your Rage Resource Die and subtract the result from the resisted damage of the triggering attack.
