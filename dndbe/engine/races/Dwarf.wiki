= Dwarf =
Resilient like the mountains, dwarves were raised up from the earth in the elder days by a deity of the forge. Called by various names on different worlds - Moradin, Reorx, and others - that god gave dwarves an affinity for stone and metal and for living underground.

Squat and often bearded, the original dwarves carved cities and strongholds into mountainsides and under the earth. Their oldest legends tell of conflicts with the monsters of mountaintops and the Underdark, whether those monsters were towering giants or subterranean horrors. Inspired by those tales, dwarves of any culture often sing of valorous deeds - especially of the little overcoming the mighty.

== Dwarves of Many Worlds ==
On some worlds in the multiverse, the first dwarven settlements were built in hills or mountains, and the dwarven families who trace their ancestry to those settlements call themselves hill dwarves or mountain dwarves, respectively. Oerth and Krynn (the worlds of the Greyhawk and Dragonlance settings, respectively) are examples of worlds that have such dwarven communities.
In other worlds, dwarves have given themselves other cultural designations. For example, on the continent of Faer√ªn in the Forgotten Realms, the dwarves of the south call themselves gold dwarves, and the dwarves of the north are shield dwarves.
