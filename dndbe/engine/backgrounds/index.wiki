= Character Backgrounds =
Your character’s Background is a collection of characteristics that represent the place and occupation that were most formative for the character before they embarked on a life of adventure.

When you choose a Background, you have three options:
* Build a Background by using the rules in the “Build Your Background” section. 
* Select a premade Background from the “Sample Backgrounds” section.
* Select a premade Background from the “Sample Backgrounds” section and then customize it with the rules in the “Build Your Background” section.

No matter which Background you choose, consider these questions from your character’s viewpoint:
* How does your Background influence your current worldview?
* Do you embrace or reject your Background?
* Did you form any relationships during your Background that endure today?
