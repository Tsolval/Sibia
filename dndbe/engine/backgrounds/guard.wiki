Your feet begin to ache when you remember the countless hours you spent at your post in the tower. You were trained to keep one eye outside the wall, watching for marauders sweeping from the nearby forest, and your other eye inside the wall, searching for cutpurses and troublemakers. At the end of each shift, you bunked in the mayorâ€™s barracks alongside your fellow sentries and the dwarven smiths who kept your armor snug and your weapons sharp.
