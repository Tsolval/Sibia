*Half-Elf* - Half Human, Half Elf.  Allowed anywhere humans or elves are allowed.  Are seen with sadness by elves and sometimes ignored or mistreated.  Often mistrusted by humans, unless in an Elven land.

*Half-Orc* - Half Human, Half Orc.  Allowed anywhere there are humans or orcs.  Some communities interbreed orcs and humans to maintain and cement alliances.  In these communities, half-orcs are celebrated as a sign of a thriving community.  In other communities, half-orcs are viewed with disdain as weaklings by orcs, and may be viewed with suspicion by humans.  Half-Orcs in non-orcish lands are often hated by humans and other races. 

*Tiefling* - Half Human, Half Fiend.  Allowed anywhere there are humans.  Tieflings are accepted only by the most compassionate and understanding of creatures.  Once a tiefling becomes known in a community, they are killed or ousted as the people cannot overlook the deceitful and dangerous beings who provide the fiendish side of the tiefling's bloodline.  Given a tiefling's propensity for growing tails or horns, this often doesn't take long, and most tieflings don't survive.  Even tieflings who do good are not trusted, since they are "obviously" attempting to deceive the faithful.

*Aasimar* - Half Human, Half Celestial.  Allowed anywhere there are humans.  Aasimar are widely accepted due to their celestial heritage.  Contrary to Tieflings, Aasimar have been known to be nearly worshipped by the people, even when they have clearly demonstrated a disdain for life.  Once their bloodline is known, some will attempt to explain away any act an aasimar commits as the will of heaven.

*Changeling* - Modified Human.  Allowed among any culture.  A Changeling is a human who was touched by the trickster god Lugh, more commonly known as Coyote, Nezha, or The Trickster.  These beings are gifted with the ability to change their forms with ease and blend in with any community.

*Genasi* - Half Human, Half Elemental.  Whether they are the result of a magical experiment or the evolution of an elemental with a long association with humans.
