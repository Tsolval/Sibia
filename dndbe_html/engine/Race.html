<p>
A character's Race represents ancestry and confers game traits to the character.  A character's Background is a collection of characteristics that represent the place and occupation that were most formative for the character.  The Character Origin Overview table lists the traits your character gains from Race and Background.
</p>

<div id="Race-Creature Type"><h2 id="Creature Type" class="header"><a href="#Race-Creature Type">Creature Type</a></h2></div>
<p>
Every character and monster in the game has a Creature Type.  This is a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are.  Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. 
</p>

<p>
The following table shows all of the game's Creature Types:

<div id="Race-Size"><h2 id="Size" class="header"><a href="#Race-Size">Size</a></h2></div>
<p>
A character's Size determines the amount of space the character occupies.  Characters of most races are Medium or Small.  Certain rules affect creatures of various sizes differently.  The most important of these rules is that Small creatures have trouble wielding heavy weapons.

<div id="Race-Size-Squeezing"><h3 id="Squeezing" class="header"><a href="#Race-Size-Squeezing">Squeezing</a></h3></div>
<p>
A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it.  Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that is only 5 feet wide.  While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws.  Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it is in the smaller space.
</p>

<div id="Race-Speed"><h2 id="Speed" class="header"><a href="#Race-Speed">Speed</a></h2></div>
<p>
Speed fuels a character's movement, determining how far your character can move when Adventuring and Fighting.  A creature's speed is the distance in feet that it can walk in 1 round (6 seconds).  This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.  A creature may have multiple movement types, described below.
</p>

<p>
On its turn, a creature can move a distance up to its speed, using as much or as little of its speed as it likes.  However you are moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.  
</p>

<p>
A creature can break up its movement on its turn, using some of its speed before and after its actions.  If it has a feature like mulitattack or extra attack, or makes more than one attack roll with a spell, it can move between attacks as well.
</p>

<p>
If a creature has more than one speed, such as a walking speed and a flying speed, it can switch back and forth between speeds during its move.  When doing so, subtract the distance it has already moved from the new speed.  The result determines how much farther you can move.  If the result is 0 or less, you cannot use the new speed during the move.  
</p>

<p>
For example, a creature has a speed of Walk 30, Fly 60.  It starts its turn and flies 20 feet, then walks 10 feet.  It has moved a total of 30 feet and so cannot walk any further, but it can fly another 30 feet.
</p>

<p>
Types of movement are described below.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Race-Speed-Walk"></span><strong id="Walk">Walk</strong> - A creature's Walking speed determines how many feet it can move on its legs, tentacles, or other mobile appendages.  This speed limits the distance you can travel in a turn and can include jumping, climbing, and swimming movement.  Your Jump distance is limited by your strength, and any Crawl, Climb or Swim movement done using your Walk speed costs you 1 extra foot of movement for every foot you climb or swim.  This is the default movement type.  If a rule or feature referrs to your Speed without context, it is referring to your walking speed.

<li>
<span id="Race-Speed-Swim"></span><strong id="Swim">Swim</strong> - A creature with a swimming speed has a natural ability to swim.  A creature's Swim speed is the number of feet that it can move through liquid in one round.

<li>
<span id="Race-Speed-Climb"></span><strong id="Climb">Climb</strong> - A creature with a climbing speed has a natural climbing ability.  A creature's Climb speed is the number of feet that it can move verticaly up walls, trees, cliffs, etc.  Some creatures, such as spiders, can seemingly defy gravity as they crawl across the ceiling.  If a creature has this ability, it will be denoted as Climb (Cling).

<li>
<span id="Race-Speed-Fly"></span><strong id="Fly">Fly</strong> - A creature with a flying speed has wings, magic, or some other property which allows it to fly.  A creature's Fly speed is the number of feet that it can move through the air.  A flying creature that is knocked Prone will fall, unless it has the ability to Hover or is held aloft by magic, such as by the <a href="fly.html">fly</a> spell.

<li>
<span id="Race-Speed-Burrow"></span><strong id="Burrow">Burrow</strong> - A creature with a burrowing speed has the ability to travel through the very earth.  A creature's Burrow speed is the number of feet it can move through the ground.

</ul>

<div id="Race-Speed-Difficult Terrain"><h3 id="Difficult Terrain" class="header"><a href="#Race-Speed-Difficult Terrain">Difficult Terrain</a></h3></div>
<p>
When in difficult terrain, every foot of movement costs 1 extra foot.  This is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.  Some examples of difficult terrain are Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, shallow bogs, poisonous fumes, and the space of another creature (whether hostile or not).  Note that other movement effects stack with difficult terrain, so using your Speed to Crawl through difficult terrain will cost 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot gained, and doing so while Slowed will cost 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot moved.
</p>

<div id="Race-Speed-Being Prone"><h3 id="Being Prone" class="header"><a href="#Race-Speed-Being Prone">Being Prone</a></h3></div>
<p>
You can drop Prone without using any of your Speed.  Standing up from Prone costs 15 feet of movement.  To move while Prone, you must Crawl, use magic or teleportation.
</p>

<div id="Race-Speed-Moving Around Other Creatures"><h3 id="Moving Around Other Creatures" class="header"><a href="#Race-Speed-Moving Around Other Creatures">Moving Around Other Creatures</a></h3></div>
<p>
You can move through the space of a non-hostile creature.  In contrast, you can move through the space of a hostile creature only if that creature is two sizes larger or smaller than you.  Remember that any other creature's space is difficult terrain for you, whether hostile, non-hostile, alive, incapacitated, unconscious, or dead.  Whether a creature is friendly or hostile, you cannot willingly end your movement in its space.
</p>

<p>
If a creature is Mountable, it costs 15 feet of movement to mount the creature, at which point they may occupy the same space.
</p>

<p>
An effect may throw you into another creature's space against your will.  If this happens, both creatures are knocked prone.
</p>

<div id="Race-Speed-Travel Pace"><h3 id="Travel Pace" class="header"><a href="#Race-Speed-Travel Pace">Travel Pace</a></h3></div>
<p>
The following rules determine how far a creature can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.  
</p>

<p>
While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table.  The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect.  A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to senak around and to search an area more carefully.  
</p>

<div id="Race-Speed-Travel Pace-Forced March"><h4 id="Forced March" class="header"><a href="#Race-Speed-Travel Pace-Forced March">Forced March</a></h4></div>
<p>
The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in a day.  They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of Exhaustion.
For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour.  The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours.  On a failed save, a character suffers one level of <a href="Exhaustion.html">Exhaustion</a>.
</p>

<div id="Race-Speed-Travel Pace-Mounts &amp; Vehicles"><h4 id="Mounts &amp; Vehicles" class="header"><a href="#Race-Speed-Travel Pace-Mounts &amp; Vehicles">Mounts &amp; Vehicles</a></h4></div>
<p>
For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.
</p>

<p>
Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel (see <a href="Equipment.html">Equipment</a>), and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.
</p>

<p>
Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly. The Dungeon Master’s Guide contains more information on special methods of travel.
