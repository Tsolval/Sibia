<p>
Every creature in the game has a special tag in the rules that identifies their Creature Type, and Hybrid creatures have more than one Creature Type.  These types do not have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways.  For example, the text of the Cure Wounds Spell specifies that it does not work on a creature with the Construct type.  A Hybrid creature can be affected by a game effect if it works on any of its creature types.
