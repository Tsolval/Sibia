<p>
Each Ancestry provides racial traits, which are a collection of abilities that characters gain from their ancestors by biology and culture.  By default, all Ancestry options have a total of 8 points of racial traits allotted to them.  In order to tailor their campaign to a less magical setting or to increase difficulty, a Dungeon Master could specify a lesser amount of points to allocate to your character.  By contrast, if a DM wanted to run a higher powered campaign, they could increase the number of points they allot and allow players to choose additional traits.
</p>

<p>
The following are feats that can be chosen from for an Ancestry.  Depending on the campaign and world, the DM may decide to disallow any of these feats or allow them for specific races only.
</p>

<p>
Each feat is listed by name, followed by its cost in Points, followed by its description.  Some feats cost a negative point amount.  These are negative feats, which provide some detriment to your character in exchange for more points to spend.

<div id="Ancestral Feats-Tiny Clockwork Device"><h3 id="Tiny Clockwork Device" class="header"><a href="#Ancestral Feats-Tiny Clockwork Device">Tiny Clockwork Device</a></h3></div>
<p>
You can spend 10 minutes casting Prestidigitation to create a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 HP), such as a toy, a fire starter, or a music box.  Casting the Spell in this way consumes 10 GP worth of raw material (string, gears, and the like), which you provide during the casting.  
</p>

<p>
When you create the device, you determine its function by choosing one effect from Prestidigitation; the device produces that effect whenever you or another creature takes a Bonus Action to touch the device and activate it.  If the chosen effect has options within it, you choose one of those options for the device when you create it.  For example, if you choose the spell's ignite-extinguish effect, you determine whether the device ignites or extinguishes fire; the device does not do both.
</p>

<p>
You can have three such devices in existence at a time, and each one dismantles itself 8 hours after its creation.  You can also touch one of your devices and dismantle it as an Action.  After a device is dismantled, the 10 GP of materials used to create it can be reclaimed.
