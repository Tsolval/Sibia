<div id="Movement"><h1 id="Movement" class="header"><a href="#Movement">Movement</a></h1></div>
<p>
When a creature Moves, it can go a distance up to its Speed, which represents how far a creature can move in short, adrenaline-driven bursts of movement.  It can also use its Speed to climb or swim, but if it does so, every foot the creature moves costs 1 extra point of Speed. A creature can also break up its Move, using some of its movement before and after any Action it takes on the same turn.  If it does so, its total distance moved must not exceed its Speed.  If a creature has multiattack, Extra Attack or any other feature that allows it to attack more than once, then it can move between attacks as well.
</p>

<p>
Some creatures have special speeds, such as a Climb Speed, a Fly Speed, a Swim Speed, or a Burrow Speed. If a creature has more than one speed, it must choose which one to use each time it takes its Move.  If the creature takes more than on Move, such as with a Dash Action, it can choose to use the same speed for each move or different ones. 
</p>

<div id="Movement-Burrow Speed"><h2 id="Burrow Speed" class="header"><a href="#Movement-Burrow Speed">Burrow Speed</a></h2></div>
<p>
A Burrow Speed can be used to move through sand, earth, mud or ice.  It can’t burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.
</p>

<div id="Movement-Climb Speed"><h2 id="Climb Speed" class="header"><a href="#Movement-Climb Speed">Climb Speed</a></h2></div>
<p>
A Climb Speed can be used to move on a vertical surface without expending the extra movement normally associated with climbing. A Climb Speed can also be used in any situation in which your Speed is usable.
Some creatures have the Spider Climb trait, which allows their Climb Speed to work even on the underside of horizontal surfaces. 
</p>

<div id="Movement-Fly Speed"><h2 id="Fly Speed" class="header"><a href="#Movement-Fly Speed">Fly Speed</a></h2></div>
<p>
A Fly Speed can be used to move through the air. While you have a Fly Speed, you can stay aloft until you land, fall, or die.
While flying, you fall if you are Incapacitated or Restrained. If you have the Hover trait, you can stay aloft even while Incapacitated or Restrained
</p>

<div id="Movement-Swim Speed"><h2 id="Swim Speed" class="header"><a href="#Movement-Swim Speed">Swim Speed</a></h2></div>
<p>
A Swim Speed can be used to move through a liquid without expending the extra movement normally associated with swimming.  A creature can't breath underwater unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.
</p>

<div id="Movement-Jump [Action]"><h2 id="Jump [Action]" class="header"><a href="#Movement-Jump [Action]">Jump [Action]</a></h2></div>
<p>
With the Jump Action, you attempt to leap more than 5 feet (a jump of 5 feet or less is treated as Difficult Terrain). When you take this Action, your Speed must be greater than 0, and you must make a DC 10 Strength Check (Acrobatics or Athletics). If you don’t Move at least 10 feet immediately before this Action, you have Disadvantage on the check.  On a failed check, you leap 5 feet horizontally or vertically. On a successful check, the check’s total determines the distance in feet that you can clear horizontally, or half that total if you’re jumping vertically (round down). This jump doesn’t expend your movement, but the distance you clear can’t exceed your Speed.
</p>

<div id="Movement-Difficult Terrain"><h2 id="Difficult Terrain" class="header"><a href="#Movement-Difficult Terrain">Difficult Terrain</a></h2></div>
<p>
A creature moving through Difficult Terrain is <a href="../conditions.html#Hindered">Hindered</a>.  This is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.  Some examples of difficult terrain are Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, shallow bogs, poisonous fumes, and the space of another creature (whether hostile or not).  Note that other movement effects stack with difficult terrain, so using your Speed to Crawl through difficult terrain will cost 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot gained, and doing so while Slowed will cost 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot moved.
</p>

<p>
At the DMs discretion, climbing a vertical surface that is slippery or has few handholds, or gaining any distance in rough water might be Difficult Terrain, or it might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check to pass.
</p>

<div id="Movement-Being Prone"><h2 id="Being Prone" class="header"><a href="#Movement-Being Prone">Being Prone</a></h2></div>
<p>
Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are <a href="../conditions.html#Prone">Prone</a>. You can drop Prone without using any of your speed. Standing up from Prone costs 15 feet of movement.  You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.
</p>

<p>
Prone creatures are vulnerable to attackers within 5 feet, but are harder to hit from further away.
</p>

<p>
To move while Prone, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation.
</p>

<p>
If a flying creature is knocked prone, then it will fall and take damage unless it can hover.    
</p>

<div id="Movement-Moving Around Other Creatures"><h2 id="Moving Around Other Creatures" class="header"><a href="#Movement-Moving Around Other Creatures">Moving Around Other Creatures</a></h2></div>
<p>
During its Move, a creature can pass through the space of an ally, an Incapacitated creature, or any creature that is two Sizes larger or smaller than it.  Another creature’s space is <a href="movement.html#Difficult Terrain">Difficult Terrain</a>.  A creature can’t willingly end its Move in a space occupied by another creature.
</p>

<p>
An effect may throw you into another creature's space against your will.  If this happens, both creatures are knocked <a href="../conditions.html#Prone">Prone</a>.
</p>

<p>
If a creature is Mountable, it costs 15 feet of movement to mount the creature, at which point the two creatures may occupy the same space.  A creature may dismount with no movement cost, so long as there is an unoccupied space within 5 feet of their mount that they can occupy.
</p>

<div id="Movement-Travel Pace"><h2 id="Travel Pace" class="header"><a href="#Movement-Travel Pace">Travel Pace</a></h2></div>
<p>
The following rules determine how far a creature can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.

<p>
While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table.  The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect.  A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.  
</p>

<p>
The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace Table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors.  But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground - all considered <a href="movement.html#Difficult Terrain">Difficult Terrain</a>, halving the distance you can travel in these environments.
</p>

<div id="Movement-Travel Pace-Forced March"><h3 id="Forced March" class="header"><a href="#Movement-Travel Pace-Forced March">Forced March</a></h3></div>
<p>
The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in a day.  They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of Exhaustion.
</p>

<p>
For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour.  The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours.  On a failed save, a character suffers one level of <a href="Conditions.html#Exhaustion">Exhaustion</a>.
</p>

<div id="Movement-Travel Pace-Mounts &amp; Vehicles"><h3 id="Mounts &amp; Vehicles" class="header"><a href="#Movement-Travel Pace-Mounts &amp; Vehicles">Mounts &amp; Vehicles</a></h3></div>
<p>
For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.
</p>

<p>
Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel (see <a href="Equipment.html">Equipment</a>), and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.
</p>

<p>
Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly. The Dungeon Master’s Guide contains more information on special methods of travel.
</p>

<div id="Movement-Activity while Traveling"><h2 id="Activity while Traveling" class="header"><a href="#Movement-Activity while Traveling">Activity while Traveling</a></h2></div>
<p>
As adventurers travel through a dungeon or the wilderness, they need to remain alert for danger, and some characters might perform other tasks to help the group’s journey.
</p>

<div id="Movement-Activity while Traveling-Marching Order"><h3 id="Marching Order" class="header"><a href="#Movement-Activity while Traveling-Marching Order">Marching Order</a></h3></div>
<p>
The adventurers should establish a marching order. A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies when a fight breaks out.
</p>

<p>
A character might occupy the front rank, one or more middle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front and back ranks need enough room to travel side by side with others in their rank. When space is too tight, the marching order must change, usually by moving characters to a middle rank.
</p>

<p>
Fewer Than Three Ranks. If an adventuring party arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they are a front rank and a back rank. If there’s only one rank, it’s considered a front rank.
</p>

<div id="Movement-Activity while Traveling-Stealth"><h3 id="Stealth" class="header"><a href="#Movement-Activity while Traveling-Stealth">Stealth</a></h3></div>
<p>
While traveling at a slow pace, the characters can move stealthily. As long as they’re not in the open, they can try to surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter. See the rules for hiding in chapter 7 "Using Ability Scores."
</p>

<div id="Movement-Activity while Traveling-Splitting Up The Party"><h3 id="Splitting Up The Party" class="header"><a href="#Movement-Activity while Traveling-Splitting Up The Party">Splitting Up The Party</a></h3></div>
<p>
Sometimes, it makes sense to split an adventuring party, especially if you want one or more characters to scout ahead. You can form multiple parties, each moving at a different speed. Each group has its own front, middle, and back ranks.
</p>

<p>
The drawback to this approach is that the party will be split into several smaller groups in the event of an attack. The advantage is that a small group of stealthy characters moving slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that clumsier characters would alert. A rogue and a monk moving at a slow pace are much harder to detect when they leave their dwarf fighter friend behind.
</p>

<div id="Movement-Activity while Traveling-Noticing Threats"><h3 id="Noticing Threats" class="header"><a href="#Movement-Activity while Traveling-Noticing Threats">Noticing Threats</a></h3></div>
<p>
Use the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the characters to determine whether anyone in the group notices a hidden threat. The DM might decide that a threat can be noticed only by characters in a particular rank. For example, as the characters are exploring a maze of tunnels, the DM might decide that only those characters in the back rank have a chance to hear or spot a stealthy creature following the group, while characters in the front and middle ranks cannot.
</p>

<p>
While traveling at a fast pace, characters take a –5 penalty to their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to notice hidden threats.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Movement-Activity while Traveling-Noticing Threats-Encountering Creatures."></span><strong id="Encountering Creatures.">Encountering Creatures.</strong> If the DM determines that the adventurers encounter other creatures while they’re traveling, it’s up to both groups to decide what happens next. Either group might decide to attack, initiate a conversation, run away, or wait to see what the other group does.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Movement-Activity while Traveling-Noticing Threats-Surprising Foes."></span><strong id="Surprising Foes.">Surprising Foes.</strong> If the adventurers encounter a hostile creature or group, the DM determines whether the adventurers or their foes might be surprised when combat erupts. See chapter 9 for more about surprise.
</p>

<div id="Movement-Activity while Traveling-Other Activities"><h3 id="Other Activities" class="header"><a href="#Movement-Activity while Traveling-Other Activities">Other Activities</a></h3></div>
<p>
Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels are not focused on watching for danger. These characters don’t contribute their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to the group’s chance of noticing hidden threats. However, a character not watching for danger can do one of the following activities instead, or some other activity with the DM’s permission.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Movement-Activity while Traveling-Other Activities-Navigate."></span><strong id="Navigate.">Navigate.</strong> The character can try to prevent the group from becoming lost, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide has rules to determine whether the group gets lost.)
</p>

<p>
<span id="Movement-Activity while Traveling-Other Activities-Draw a Map."></span><strong id="Draw a Map.">Draw a Map.</strong> The character can draw a map that records the group’s progress and helps the characters get back on course if they get lost. No ability check is required.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Movement-Activity while Traveling-Other Activities-Track."></span><strong id="Track.">Track.</strong> A character can follow the tracks of another creature, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide has rules for tracking.)
</p>

<p>
<span id="Movement-Activity while Traveling-Other Activities-Forage."></span><strong id="Forage.">Forage.</strong> The character can keep an eye out for ready sources of food and water, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide has rules for foraging.)
