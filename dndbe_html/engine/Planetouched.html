<p>
A creature or object that is planetouched was affected by the essence of another plane of existence.  This causes the planetouched to display properties of the plane in question.
There are multiple examples of how interacting with another plane of existence might alter a creature.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Elves are fey who are planetouched by the mundane plane.

<li>
Genasi, Aasimar, and Tieflings are humans planetouched by elemental, celestial, and fiendish planes, respectively.

</ul>
