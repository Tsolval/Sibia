<p>
A character's Size determines the amount of space the character occupies.  Characters of most races are Medium or Small.  Certain rules affect creatures of various sizes differently.  The most important of these rules is that Small creatures have trouble wielding heavy weapons.

<div id="Creature Sizes-Space"><h2 id="Space" class="header"><a href="#Creature Sizes-Space">Space</a></h2></div>
<p>
A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5‐foot-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.
</p>

<p>
A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.  A creature cannot attack if it shares its space with another creature unless one has mounted the other.
</p>

<p>
Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If four Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.
</p>

<div id="Creature Sizes-Squeezing"><h2 id="Squeezing" class="header"><a href="#Creature Sizes-Squeezing">Squeezing</a></h2></div>
<p>
A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it.  Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that is only 5 feet wide.  While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws.  Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it is in the smaller space.
