<em>1st Level Feat</em>
</p>

<p>
<span id="Magic Initiate-Prerequisite:"></span><strong id="Prerequisite:">Prerequisite:</strong> None
<span id="Magic Initiate-Repeatable:"></span><strong id="Repeatable:">Repeatable:</strong> Yes, but you must choose a different Spell list each time
</p>

<p>
You have learned the basics of a particular magical tradition. Choose one Spell list: Arcane, Divine, or Primal. You gain the following benefits related to that choice:
</p>

<p>
<span id="Magic Initiate-Two Cantrips."></span><strong id="Two Cantrips.">Two Cantrips.</strong> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Spell list.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Magic Initiate-1st-Level Spell."></span><strong id="1st-Level Spell.">1st-Level Spell.</strong> Choose one 1st-level Spell from the Spell list. You always have that Spell prepared. You can cast it once without a Spell Slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest.* You can also cast the Spell using any Spell Slots you have.
</p>

<p>
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these Spells (choose when you select this Feat). Consult the Playerâ€™s Handbook for the rules on spellcasting.
</p>

<p>
Whenever you gain a new level, you can replace one of the Spells you chose for this Feat with a different Spell of the same level from the chosen Spell list.
