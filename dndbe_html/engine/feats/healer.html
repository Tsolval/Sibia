You have the training and intuition to administer first aid and other care effectively, granting you the following benefits:
</p>

<p>
<span id="Healer-Battle Medic."></span><strong id="Battle Medic.">Battle Medic.</strong> If you have a Healer's Kit, you can expend one use of it and tend to a creature within 5 feet of you as an Action.  That creature can expend one of its Hit Dice, and you then roll that die.  The creature regains a number of Hit Points equal to the roll plus your Proficiency Bonus.
<span id="Healer-Healing Rerolls."></span><strong id="Healing Rerolls.">Healing Rerolls.</strong> Whenever you roll a die to determine the number of Hit Points you restore with a spell or with this feat's Battle Medic benefit, you can reroll the die if it rolls a 1, and you must use the new roll.
