<p>
Anyone can swing a sword or throw a punch.  We take peasants out of the streets every day and put them to work in the guard and the army.  Training them how to kill the enemy without killing themselves doesn't make these people fighters.  A Fighter has something special on their side.  They think tactically and they place their blades exactly where they are needed and with exactly the force required, no more.  A true Fighter can end a conflict without drawing a single drop of blood.
</p>

<div id="Fighter-Creating a Fighter"><h2 id="Creating a Fighter" class="header"><a href="#Fighter-Creating a Fighter">Creating a Fighter</a></h2></div>
<p>
When you create your Fighter character, think about where they come from.  Where did they learn to fight?  Do they have a preferred weapon?  Are they working as a guard or in the army?  Are they fighting in underground tourneys or gladiator pits?  Or are they trying to leave that life behind?  
</p>

<p>
When you build your Fighter, you should put your highest Ability Scores into Strength or Dexterity, depending on your weapon of choice, and Constitution.  Spellcasting Fighters might take their spellcasting ability as their second highest value instead.

<p>
You can take any class you want at 1st level, whether you qualify for it or not.  But in order to take levels in a different class, you must qualify for both your original class and the class you wish to take a level in. 
</p>

<p>
To multiclass as a Fighter, you must have a Strength or Dexterity Score of at least 13.

<div id="Fighter-Details-Tactics"><h3 id="Tactics" class="header"><a href="#Fighter-Details-Tactics">Tactics</a></h3></div>
<p>
You have a Tactics <a href="../resource-die.html">Resource Die</a> which starts as a 1d4.  As you grow in power as a Fighter, your Resource Die will grow with you, and you will gain other abilities that utilize your Resource Die as well.  Your Resource Die increases at levels 5 (1d6), 9 (1d8), 13 (1d10), 17(1d12). 
You can use your Tactics Resource Die to perform the following actions.  You will gain more features that consume your resource as you advance in this class.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="Fighter-Details-Tactics-Tactical Mark."></span><strong id="Tactical Mark.">Tactical Mark.</strong>  When you make a melee attack against a creature, you can Mark it until the end of its next turn, making it easier to harry it with opportunity attacks.  Any opportunity attack you make against a marked target doesn't consume your reaction, though you are limited to one opportunity attack per turn, and you may not make an opportunity attack if an Effect, such as Shocking Grasp, or Condition, like Incapacitated, would prevent you from using your reaction.  When you take an opportunity attack against a Marked target, you can roll your Tactics Resource Die and add the result to either the to hit or the damage roll.

<li>
<span id="Fighter-Details-Tactics-Tactical Shove."></span><strong id="Tactical Shove.">Tactical Shove.</strong> When you take the Shove action, you can shove your target in any direction, not just away from you.  Roll your Tactics Resource Die and add the result to your Strength (Athletics) check.  If the target fails their Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, they are moved up to 5 feet to an unoccupied space within your reach.  If they fail their check by 10 or more points, you may also knock them prone.

<li>
<span id="Fighter-Details-Tactics-Tactical Overrun."></span><strong id="Tactical Overrun.">Tactical Overrun.</strong> When a creature tries to move through a hostile creature’s space, the mover can try to force its way through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an action or a bonus action, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the hostile creature’s Strength (Athletics) check. The creature attempting the overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than the hostile creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller. If you win the contest, you can move through the hostile creature’s space once this turn.

<li>
<span id="Fighter-Details-Tactics-Tactical Tumble."></span><strong id="Tactical Tumble.">Tactical Tumble.</strong> You can try to tumble through a hostile creature’s space, ducking and weaving past your opponent. As an action or a bonus action, you make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the hostile creature’s Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If you win the contest, you can move through your opponent's space once this turn.

</ul>
