<p>
While Wizards, Clerics, Druids, and the like focus on manipulating the energies outside the body, Monks focus inward, to the energies flowing within each individual, to an energy they call ki.  Monks can enhance their own ki to power the speed and power of their attacks or they can hinder or block an opponent's ki, rendering them weaker or even powerless.  Monks can use this energy to create their own forms of magic without casting a single spell.

<p>
When you create your Monk character, think about where they come from.  Most monks were raised in a monastery, but maybe your Monk came by their knowledge on their own or via an accident. Perhaps you were discovered and guided by a wandering monk.
</p>

<p>
When you build your Monk, you should put your highest Ability Scores into Dexterity and Wisdom.

<div id="Monk-Multiclassing"><h2 id="Multiclassing" class="header"><a href="#Monk-Multiclassing">Multiclassing</a></h2></div>
<p>
You can take any class you want at 1st level, whether you qualify for it or not.  But in order to take levels in a different class, you must qualify for both your original class and the class you wish to take a level in. 
</p>

<p>
To multiclass as a Monk, your Dexterity Score and Wisdom Score must both be at least 13.
