You have a Rage <a href="../resource-die.html">Resource Die</a> which starts as a 1d4.  As you grow in power as a Barbarian, your Resource Die will grow with you, and you will gain other abilities that utilize your Resource Die as well.  Your Resource Die increases at levels 5 (1d6), 9 (1d8), 13 (1d10), 17(1d12). 
You can use your Rage Resource Die to perform the following actions so long as you aren't wearing heavy armor.  You will gain more features that consume your resource as you advance in this class.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="Barbarian-Barbarian Feats-Rage-Raging Blows."></span><strong id="Raging Blows.">Raging Blows.</strong> When you take the Attack Action on your turn and hit with a Weapon Attack, you can roll the Resource Die and add the result to your weapon damage.  

<li>
<span id="Barbarian-Barbarian Feats-Rage-Raging Strength."></span><strong id="Raging Strength.">Raging Strength.</strong> When you make a d20 Test involving Strength, you can roll your Resource Die and add the result to your d20 Test.

<li>
<span id="Barbarian-Barbarian Feats-Rage-Raging Resistance."></span><strong id="Raging Resistance.">Raging Resistance.</strong> Until you have exhausted your Rage, you are resistant to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.  When you are damaged by an attack that deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you may attempt to reduce that damage further.  As a reaction, roll your Rage Resource Die and subtract the result from the resisted damage of the triggering attack.

</ul>
<div id="Barbarian-Barbarian Feats-Unarmored Defense"><h3 id="Unarmored Defense" class="header"><a href="#Barbarian-Barbarian Feats-Unarmored Defense">Unarmored Defense</a></h3></div>
<p>
Level: 1
Requirements: Barbarian
Repeatable: No
</p>

<p>
While you are not wearing armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity Modifier + your Constitution Modifier.  You can use a shield and still gain this benefit, since a shield counts as cover, not as armor.
</p>

<div id="Barbarian-Barbarian Feats-Reckless Attack"><h3 id="Reckless Attack" class="header"><a href="#Barbarian-Barbarian Feats-Reckless Attack">Reckless Attack</a></h3></div>
<p>
Level: 1
Requirements: Barbarian
Repeatable: No
</p>

<p>
You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation.  When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly.  Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.
</p>

<div id="Barbarian-Barbarian Feats-Danger Sense"><h3 id="Danger Sense" class="header"><a href="#Barbarian-Barbarian Feats-Danger Sense">Danger Sense</a></h3></div>
<p>
Level: 1
Requirements: Barbarian
Repeatable: No
</p>

<p>
You gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.  You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells.  To gain this benefit, you cannot be Blinded, Deafened, or Incapacitated.

<p>
Level: 5
Requirements: Barbarian
Repeatable: No
</p>

<p>
Your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.  In addition, at the start of your first turn after rolling initiative, so long as you are not Incapacitated, you can roll your Rage Resource Die and gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the result.  While you are protected by your Rage in this way, you may act normally on your turn, even if you would otherwise be unable to due to being surprised, frightened, petrified, slowed, etc.
</p>

<p>
Level: 9
Requirements: Barbarian
Repeatable: No
</p>

<p>
Your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds.  While you retain your Rage, if you drop to 0 hit points and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, adding a roll of your Rage Resource Die.  If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.  Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5.  When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.
