<p>
Gnomes are magical folk created by gods of hard work, invention, trickery, and life underground. The earliest gnomes were seldom seen by other folk due to the gnomes’ secretive nature and their propensity for lairing in sylvan forests, hillside burrows, and sprawling warrens under mountains. What they lacked in size, they made up for in cleverness and cunning. They confounded predators with elaborate traps and low, narrow, labyrinthine tunnels. They also learned useful magic from gods like Garl Glittergold, Baervan Wildwanderer, and Baravar Cloakshadow, who often lived among them (usually in disguise).
</p>

<p>
Gnomes are petite folk with big eyes, pointed ears, and wistful imaginations. Harkening back to a time when their ancestors hid in tunnels and under thick forest canopies, many gnomes like the feeling of a roof over their head, even if that “roof” is nothing more than a hat.

<div id="Gnome-Gnome Traits-Tiny Clockwork Device"><h3 id="Tiny Clockwork Device" class="header"><a href="#Gnome-Gnome Traits-Tiny Clockwork Device">Tiny Clockwork Device</a></h3></div>
<p>
You can spend 10 minutes casting Prestidigitation to create a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 HP), such as a toy, a fire starter, or a music box.  Casting the Spell in this way consumes 10 GP worth of raw material (string, gears, and the like), which you provide during the casting.  
</p>

<p>
When you create the device, you determine its function by choosing one effect from Prestidigitation; the device produces that effect whenever you or another creature takes a Bonus Action to touch the device and activate it.  If the chosen effect has options within it, you choose one of those options for the device when you create it.  For example, if you choose the spell's ignite-extinguish effect, you determine whether the device ignites or extinguishes fire; the device does not do both.
</p>

<p>
You can have three such devices in existence at a time, and each one dismantles itself 8 hours after its creation.  You can also touch one of your devices and dismantle it as an Action.  After a device is dismantled, the 10 GP of materials used to create it can be reclaimed.

Gnomes past and present are known to equate secrecy with safety, which is why gnome settlements are often tucked away or concealed by magical illusions.

<span id="Gnome-Gnomes of Many Worlds-Forest Gnomes."></span><strong id="Forest Gnomes.">Forest Gnomes.</strong> Gnomes who have ancestral ties to forests are called forest gnomes. They use their magic to befriend small forest animals and rely on them for news concerning their neighbors - be they malevolent or benign.

<span id="Gnome-Gnomes of Many Worlds-Rock Gnomes."></span><strong id="Rock Gnomes.">Rock Gnomes.</strong> Gnomes whose ancestors dwelled under mountains are called rock gnomes. On some worlds, including Krynn (the world of the Dragonlance setting), rock gnomes are also known as tinker gnomes due to their fondness for artifice and clockwork inventions.
