<div id="Conditions"><h1 id="Conditions" class="header"><a href="#Conditions">Conditions</a></h1></div>
<p>
Conditions alter the properties of a creature or area and can change a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways.  They can arise as a natural environmental effect, the result of a spell, class feature, attack, or other effect.  Most conditions are impairments, but some can be advantageous.  
</p>

<p>
A condition lasts either until it is countered or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condtition.  The Prone condition, for instance, can be countered by standing up, while the Invisible condition may end when a creature attacks or casts a spell (Invisibility spell) or after a specified duration (Greater Invisibility spell).
</p>

<p>
If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects do not get worse.  A creature either has a condition or it does not.
</p>

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected ot a condition.

<div id="Conditions-Hidden"><h2 id="Hidden" class="header"><a href="#Conditions-Hidden">Hidden</a></h2></div>
<p>
A creature that is Hidden is using magic or skill to make themselves hard to detect.  Hidden creatures make little noise, leave only the faintest tracks and mask their odors to make themselves as hard as possible to locate.  A creature does not know the location of any creature that is Hidden from them.  A creature who cannot be located cannot be directly targeted by an attack, ability or spell, though an attacker can guess at a location and target a space, making an attack as if <a href="conditions.html#Blinded">Blinded</a>.  If they hit, they learn the location of the hidden creature.  If they miss, or target a space the hidden creature doesn't occupy, they only discover that they missed.  A creature may spend an action to attempt an appropriate Ability Check, usually a Wisdom (Perception) check, to locate a hidden creature.  A Hidden creature is <a href="conditions.html#Braced">Braced</a> and <a href="conditions.html#Steady">Steady</a> against creatures it is hidden from.

<p>
A hindered creature finds it difficult to move.  It must spend 1 extra foot of movement for every foot it moves using its Speed.   Note that multiple effects may cause a creature to become Hindered.  These effects will stack together, increasing the cost of movement, but two effects with the same name cannot stack.  Thus, Difficult Terrain can stack with Slowed, but cannot stack with itself.  For example, when you walk normally, every foot you move costs you 1 foot of movement.  If you drop Prone and crawl, every foot now costs 2 foot of movement.  If you crawl through Difficult Terrain, every foot now costs 3 foot of movement.
